I want you to generate a large array of chat messages in JSON format with the following rules:

Each message is an object with two keys: "username" and "message". Example:

{"username": "NightOwl", "message": "Hey everyone!"}


There should be 5–8 main recurring usernames who appear frequently and consistently.

Random new usernames should appear occasionally. Each new username says "hi" once, and one of the recurring users always responds to them. The new username does not reply after that.

Messages should mimic casual, playful, slightly chaotic chat conversation. Include:

Greetings

Reactions to other users

Funny or quirky comments

Exaggeration, emojis, or internet slang (optional)

Keep consistency in personality and style for recurring users.

The array should be large enough to represent 20–30 minutes of chatting (~500 messages).

Output only the JSON array, nothing else.

Example output style:

[
{"username": "NightOwl", "message": "Hey everyone!"},
{"username": "VelvetVibe", "message": "NightOwl, finally!"},
{"username": "NewUser123", "message": "hi"},
{"username": "NightOwl", "message": "Hey NewUser123, welcome!"}
]
